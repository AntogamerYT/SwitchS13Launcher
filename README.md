# Nintendo Switch S13 Launcher

Made by me to make Epic Games Auth easier


## Building

Make sure you have DevKitPro/MSYS2 installed 

- Clone the repo
- Install switch-curl in your environment
- Run `make`

This should produce an nro in the root folder of the project, transfer it on your switch and enjoy

> [!WARNING]
> S13 requires a proxy to work, you can find that too in the Fortnite Switch Modding server.
